      <p class="c2">The General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is a radio communication service primarily used in the
      United States and Canada. It falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the
      U.S. and is regulated by Innovation, Science, and Economic Development Canada (ISED) in Canada. GMRS is designed to provide short-range,
      point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication for both personal and business use.</p>

      <p class="c2">GMRS radios operate on UHF frequencies, typically in the 462-467 MHz range, allowing for reliable communication
      over short to medium distances, depending on the terrain and power output. Unlike the Family Radio Service (FRS), GMRS radios are
      more powerful and can legally transmit at higher wattages, which can extend their effective range. GMRS radios are often used for
      outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and hunting, as well as for family or business communication over relatively short
      distances.</p>

      <p class="c2">In the United States, the use of GMRS requires a license from the FCC, which covers an individual or a family. The
      license is relatively easy to obtain, and it allows the licensee and their immediate family members to use GMRS radios. This
      licensing requirement helps manage the use of GMRS frequencies and ensures efficient and interference-free communication for all
      users of the service. GMRS is a valuable tool for personal and small-scale professional communication, offering a convenient way to
      stay in touch in various situations.</p>
